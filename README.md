# Banking System Application – Summer Internship Project at Upskill Campus

A console-based **banking system application** developed as part of the Upskill Campus Summer Internship. Built using **Core Java**, this project simulates a basic banking environment where users can:

- **Create accounts** with personal details.
- **Check account balances**.
- **Deposit and withdraw funds**.
- **View transaction history**—all operations are logged for review.

**Technologies & Concepts Used:**
- Core Java: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File I/O, Exception Handling, Collections, and Multithreading.
- Data Storage: CSV files used to manage and persist user and transaction data.

**Requirements:**
- Java JDK 8 or higher installed.
- Read/write access to the CSV files used for data storage.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Integrate a database system (e.g., MySQL or SQLite) using JDBC.
- Add user authentication and encrypt sensitive data for improved security.

**Contributions:**
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues with your suggestions and improvements.
